# Smart Study Assistant 📚

## Description
Smart Study Assistant is a beginner-friendly, rule-based AI project
designed to help students decide their study priority based on the
difficulty level of subjects.

The user inputs subject names along with their difficulty levels,
and the program intelligently arranges the subjects from hardest
to easiest to guide effective study planning.

---

## Objective
To demonstrate how basic Artificial Intelligence concepts such as
rule-based decision making and prioritisation can be implemented
using simple Python logic.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Script (.py)

---

## AI Concept Used
Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence  
The program follows predefined rules to analyse user input and
make decisions without using machine learning.

---

## How It Works
1. The user enters the number of subjects.
2. The user assigns a difficulty level to each subject.
3. The program sorts subjects based on difficulty.
4. The final output shows the study order from highest to lowest priority.
